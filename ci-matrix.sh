# Run an import smoke check and pytest under every interpreter version in the
# supported range (see `requires-python` in pyproject.toml). This is not part
# of ci.sh because materialising a venv per version is slow; invoke this
# before releases and after changes that could depend on version-specific
# runtime behaviour (import-time annotations, stdlib APIs, etc.).
#
# The linters and type checkers are deliberately not repeated here. ci.sh runs
# them once, and they are configured against a fixed target version
# (target-version/python_version in pyproject.toml), so re-running them per
# interpreter would report the same thing four times.
#
# Missing interpreters are pulled automatically from uv's managed Python
# cache (python-build-standalone), so no system packages or sudo are needed.
#
# Override the version list: PYTHONS="3.11 3.14" ./ci-matrix.sh
#
# After the interpreter sweep it runs one "floor" lane: the project resolved
# to the *minimum* versions our metadata allows (uv --resolution
# lowest-direct), then the suite. This is what catches a dependency floor that
# is declared but does not actually work -- our `liblore>=0.9.0` and
# `click>=8.1.7` bounds are claims about what we support, and every other lane
# resolves the newest compatible release instead, so nothing else tests them.
# It runs on the lowest supported interpreter, where the old dependency
# releases are likeliest to still publish wheels. Override or skip it:
# FLOOR_PY=3.12 ./ci-matrix.sh  (or FLOOR_PY= ./ci-matrix.sh to skip)
#
# After the floor lane it runs one advisory "prerelease" lane, on the newest
# CPython not yet in PYTHONS (a beta ahead of its final release, say), so we
# get an early signal without waiting on a relock. It resolves fresh against
# PyPI instead of uv.lock, and never fails the run -- see the lane itself for
# why. Override or skip it: PRERELEASE_PY=3.16 ./ci-matrix.sh (or
# PRERELEASE_PY= ./ci-matrix.sh to skip)

# ${VAR-default} rather than ${VAR:-default}: the latter also substitutes for
# an explicitly empty value, which would make "PYTHONS= ./ci-matrix.sh" run
# the full sweep instead of skipping it.
